### What We Mean by Precarity

Precarity in research is widespread, driven by reliance on fixed-term contracts, unstable funding, and shrinking of the higher education sector. This insecurity affects researchers at all career stages, teaching-focused roles, technical specialists, professional services staff, and research professionals.  

Surveys and discussions with researchers consistently show that these conditions create high levels of stress and uncertainty. Early career researchers often work on contracts that provide limited job security, and many report that competition and contractual instability can make workplaces feel unkind, unsafe, or unsustainable. Precarity is structural and cultural, not just contractual.
