## What We Mean by Precarity in Research

Precarity in research is widespread, driven by reliance on fixed-term contracts, unstable funding, and shrinking of the higher education sector. This insecurity affects researchers at all career stages, teaching-focused roles, technical specialists, professional services staff, and research professionals.  

Surveys and discussions with researchers consistently show that these conditions create high levels of stress and uncertainty, with many feeling unable to plan long-term for their careers. Early career researchers often work on contracts that provide limited job security, and many report that competition and contractual instability can make workplaces feel unkind, unsafe, or unsustainable. These pressures are both structural and cultural, demonstrating that precarity is not just about employment contracts but also about the environment in which research is conducted.
