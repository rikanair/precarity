## Against Precarity in Research Careers

The **Precarity in Research Working Group** is a collective initiative taking action to reduce the level and impact of employment precarity across research-related careers in higher education institutions.

### Our Vision

## What We Mean by Precarity in Research

Precarity in research is widespread, driven by reliance on fixed-term contracts, unstable funding, and shrinking of the higher education sector. This insecurity affects researchers at all career stages, teaching focussed roles, technical specialists, professional services staff, and research professionals. 

Surveys and discussions with researchers consistently show that these conditions create high levels of stress and uncertainty, with many feeling unable to plan long-term for their careers. For example, early career researchers often work on contracts that provide limited job security, and many report that competition and contractual instability can make workplaces feel unkind, unsafe, or unsustainable. These pressures are both structural and cultural, demonstrating that precarity is not just about employment contracts but also about the environment in which research is conducted.

### Case Studies

- Examples of lived experience across different roles and contexts.  
- Focused illustrations of how precarity impacts research outcomes and career progression.

## Stakeholder Engagement

- **Funders:** Understand the impact and use your influence to make positive change.  
- **Institutions:** Collaborate to improve systems, share responsibility, and take meaningful action.  
- **Unions:** Support members, actively campaign, and collaborate to drive systemic change.  

> We need a coordinated national effort to tackle precarity. Your voice, expertise, and lived experience are vital.
